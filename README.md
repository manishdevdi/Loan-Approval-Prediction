# 🚀 Loan Approval Prediction

## 📚 Project Overview  
Loan Approval Prediction is a **machine learning-based solution** that predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to be approved based on various financial and personal details. This project leverages **data science techniques** to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
🔹 **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
🔹 **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
🔹 **Machine Learning Models:** Decision Tree, Random Forest  
🔹 **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive analysis 📊  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
✅ Applicant’s Income & Credit History  
✅ Loan Amount & Purpose  
✅ Employment & Marital Status  
✅ Property Area  

🔹 **Target Variable:** Loan Approval Status (Approved/Not Approved)  

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✔️ Checked for missing values and handled them  
✔️ Dropped unnecessary columns (e.g., **loan_id**)  
✔️ Visualized distributions of Income, Loan Amount, and Credit Score  
✔️ Analyzed correlation between different features and Loan Approval  

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
