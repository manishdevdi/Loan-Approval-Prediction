# 🚀 Loan Approval Prediction

## 📚 Project Overview  
Loan Approval Prediction is a **machine learning-based solution** that predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to be approved based on various financial and personal details. This project leverages **data science techniques** to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.
